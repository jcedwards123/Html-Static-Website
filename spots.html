                My favorite NYC dessert spot is probably Dough Donuts, they provide a wide range of innovative and artisanal tastes in addition to the classic glazed doughnuts. <br>
                Hibiscus(my favorite), dulce de leche, passion fruit, and huckleberry are a few of their specialties. Dough stands out from numerous other doughnut businesses thanks to its creative taste combinations.

            <p>The location of the previous Pier 54, which was historically significant as the point of departure for the tragic RMS Titanic in 1912, is now the location of Little Island, a floating park. <br>
                The park appears to be "floating" on the water because it is built on a number of concrete piles that reach into the Hudson River. It's a super nice place to hold a picnic as the view of the hudson and the nearby view is super entertaining</p>
