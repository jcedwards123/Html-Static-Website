            <p>
                One interesting skill I can share is my proficiency in karate. I currently am i black belt candidate in tae kwondo and I've been training for 7 years. <br>Unfortunately the studio closed down due to the pandemic, 
                but I hope one day it can re-open so I can finally get my black belt. I think i can generally teach the basics of self defense so people can better protect themselves through form and practice.
