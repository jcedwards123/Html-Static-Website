                Here, I'll discuss some of my favorite hobbies and interests, such as cooking and biking. Ever since I was young, I've always viewed cooking as an art of its own, and I've taken it upon myself to learn how to cook plenty of different dishes across the years!<br>
                Some of my favorite foods to cook include penne alla vodka, fried rice, and curry. I cook them pretty often for my family and we tend to work together to make lunch and dinner. Some of my favorite foods<br>
                to eat include chicken katsu, pad thai, and cheeseburgers. As for biking, I like doing it around fort greene park and on governors island.
